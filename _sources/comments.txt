A question often asked is “which options work best” to which the answer is
always “it depends”. This is primarily because the outcome of the analysis
depends more on the quality of the data than anything else. However I
would always try for yourself and get a feel for how the program works for
your data - running both :samp:`-2d` and :samp:`-3d` will simply require more computing
time / disk space rather than more effort, so it is certainly worthwhile. For
small molecule data though :samp:`-3dii -small molecule` is a good mix. Also :samp:`-3d`
often works better for very finely sliced data.
