Program output
++++++++++++++

As the program runs the key results are written to the screen and recorded
in the file :samp:`xia2.txt`. This includes everything you should read and includes
appropriate citations for the programs that xia2 has used on your behalf.
There is also a file :samp:`xia2-debug.txt` which should be send to xia2.support@gmail.com
in the event of program failure. There are also two sensibly named directories,
:samp:`LogFiles` and :samp:`DataFiles`, which will be discussed shortly.

xia2.txt
--------

By design, the program output from xia2 includes only the information that
is critical to read, as will be shown for a 450 image Pilatus 2M data set
recorded from a thaumatin crystal. The results from indexing are displayed
as lattice / unit cell::

  ------------------- Autoindexing SWEEP1 --------------------
  All possible indexing solutions:
  tP 57.60 57.60 149.51 90.00 90.00 90.00
  oC 81.45 81.46 149.51 90.00 90.00 90.00
  oP 57.59 57.60 149.50 90.00 90.00 90.00
  mC 81.46 81.45 149.50 90.00 89.95 90.00
  mP 57.60 57.59 149.53 90.00 89.93 90.00
  aP 57.59 57.61 149.52 89.93 89.99 89.99
  Indexing solution:
  tP 57.60 57.60 149.51 90.00 90.00 90.00

where in each case the solution with the lowest penalty is displayed. The
results of integration are displayed as one character per image - which allows
the overall behaviour of the data to be understood at a glance. While
mostly ’o’ is usually a good indication of satisfactory processing, ’%’ are not
unusual, along with ’.’ for weaker data. If the output consists of mostly ’O’
then it may be helpful to record a low dose data set. The output includes a
convenient legend, and looks like the following::

  -------------------- Integrating SWEEP1 --------------------
  Processed batches 1 to 450
  Integration status per image (60/record):
  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.oooooooooooooooooooooooo
  ooooooooooooooooooooooo.ooooooooooooooooooo.ooooooo.oooooooo
  ooo.o.ooooooo.oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  oooooooooooooooooooo.ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.oooooooo
  ooooooooo.oooooooooo..ooo.oooooooooooooooooooo.ooooooooooooo
  oooooooooooooooooooo.oooooooo.
  "o" => good "%" => ok "!" => bad rmsd
  "O" => overloaded "#" => many bad "." => blank
  "@" => abandoned
  Mosaic spread: 0.140 < 0.189 < 0.290

HTML pages
----------

If xia2html has been run there is a nicely formatted html version of this
report, which includes graphical representation of some of the log file output
from e.g. Aimless. Loading up :samp:`xia2.html` will give (hopefully self documenting)
results as shown below. If you have manually run xia2,
immediately running xia2html in the same directory will generate this.
